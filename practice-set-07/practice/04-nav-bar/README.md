## CSS: Style a navigation bar

### Instructions

This is another creative exercise which allows you to apply all the knowledge you've accumulated.

Make sure the HTML is valid before proceeding. Make sure the image works. Never assume I will give you "clean" code in any exercise moving forward! }:-)

In this directory is `navigation.html`, which marks up a list that could serve as a navigation for a site. Your task is to style it so, at a minimum, the list is horizontal -- not vertical. Included in the `examples` directory is an image of a minimum solution. Focus on styling just the `nav` -- none of the other content should change.

Look at the default styles of a list in your browser's developer tools to see what may need to be adjusted. Make sure you are applying styles using the correct selector(s).

You may need to review the use of the `display` property and its `inline`, `block` and `inline-block` values, as well as the `list-style-type` and `padding` properties to make this work.

Once you meet the basic solution, again, **play!!!**. There are *many* ways a navigation bar can be styled. You have colors, fonts, backgrounds, text decorations, box model properties to play with! Don't neglect the link styles, either!

I have provided a simple, but creative solution as well. You can try to mirror my effort, but I recommend doing something original. Try different properties to make it wholly unique and your own.

Have some **fun** with this!
