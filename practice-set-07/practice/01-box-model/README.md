## CSS: Box Model

### Instructions

As you go through each step, I recommend checking the code in Firefox. If something is incorrect, you will find the mistake easier to catch if there is less code to review.

This is more of a walkthrough for you to see the box model in action.

1. In the file `box-model.html`, you will find content has been marked up. Each section has a unique id. You will apply styles using these id values as selectors.

2. In the file `style.css` within the `css` directory, you will see a couple styles have already been written. Do not modify this. Make sure you write all your code below the comment. For steps 4-X, write the properties in long form (i.e. `margin-top`, `margin-right`, etc.)

3. Write a selector which targets *both* the `left` and `right` box. In this CSS block, set the border to be 2 pixels wide, have a style of solid and a color of `#222`. (It's okay to write this using the `border` shorthand.)

4. Write a selector which targets the `left` box. In this CSS block, set the **padding** so the left and right sides side have 20 pixels of padding and the top and bottom sides have 10 pixels of padding. Take notice of what happens to the text in relation to the border (and the background).

5. Write a selector which targets the `right` box. In this CSS block, set the **margin** so each side has 20 pixels of margin. What happens to this box in relation to the left box? What can you say about the text in relation to the border (and the background)?

6. Re-write the declarations to use shorthand for `margin` and `padding`.

7. If you really want a challenge re-write the `border` styles so every side has a different width, style and color. (You'll end up writing 12 properties! It's unlikely you would EVER do this, but it gives practice getting familiar with CSS syntax.)
