## CSS: Style a "Polaroid"

### Instructions

This is a creative exercise which allows you to apply all the knowledge you've accumulated. We're at a point where you need to start branching out with your ideas and figuring out how to apply what you have learned in a practical sense.

Make sure the HTML is valid before proceeding. Make sure the image works. Never assume I will give you "clean" code in any exercise moving forward! }:-)

In this directory is `polaroid.html`, which marks up an image and a caption as a figure. Your task is to style it like a polaroid picture using box model and other properties you have learned thus far. Your solution should, at a minimum, look like a Polaroid. Included in the `example` directory is an image of a minimum solution.

But once you meet that requirement, **play!!!** You've learned a lot about colors, fonts, backgrounds, etc. Your book covers even more properties which can make this interesting. Try different properties to make it wholly unique and your own.

Have some **fun** with this!
