## CSS: Overflow

### Instructions

As you go through each step, I recommend checking the code in Firefox. If something is incorrect, you will find the mistake easier to catch if there is less code to review.

This is more of a walkthrough for you to see the differences in `overflow` property values.

1. In the file `overflow.html`, you will find content has been marked up. Each section has a unique id. You will apply styles using these id values as selectors.

2. In the file `style.css` within the `css` directory, you will see a couple styles have already been written. Do not modify this. Make sure you write all your code below the comment. Each section has a width/height of 200 pixels. The content within each section exceeds these dimensions.

3. Notice there is no `overflow` property on `#cat-text`. By default, `overflow` is set to visible. You can see the dimensions of this box based on the dotted line I have applied -- and the content within clearly passes below the red line at the bottom of the box.

4. Write a CSS selector which targets `cat-01`. In this CSS block, write a declaration which sets `overflow` to `hidden`. What happens to this section? (The image within is 500 pixels by 500 pixels.)

5. Write a CSS selector which targets `cat-02`. In this CSS block, write a declaration which sets `overflow` to `scroll`. What happens to this section? (The image within is 175 pixels by 242 pixels.)

6. Write a CSS selector which targets `cat-03`. In this CSS block, write a declaration which sets `overflow` to `auto`. What happens to this section? (The image within is 650 pixels by 400 pixels.)

7. Write a CSS selector which targets `cat-04`. In this CSS block, write a declaration which sets `overflow` to `auto`. What happens to this section?
