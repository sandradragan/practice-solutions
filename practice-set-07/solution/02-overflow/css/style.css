  When overflow is set to `scroll`, excess content is available to
  the user through the use of scroll bars. Only the scroll bars which
  are necessary will be displayed.

  In this case, the photo does not exceed the width of the container,
  so there is no horizontal scroll bar. However, the 'track' for a
  scroll bar still appears. Because the image exceeds the height of
  the container, a vertical scroll bar appears.

/*
  When overflow is set to `auto`, the browser determines whether
  scroll bars are necessary. In the case of the first, the image
  exceeds the width and height, so both scroll bars appear. In
  the second, however, it does not exeed the dimensions of the
  container, so no scroll bars -- or tracks -- appear.
