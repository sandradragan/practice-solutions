## CSS: Simple Grids

### Instructions

As you go through each step, I recommend checking the code in Firefox. If something is incorrect, you will find the mistake easier to catch if there is less code to review.

There is a corresponding example for each set of HTML/CSS files in this repository. Look at how the page is laid out and mimic this. Be sure to look at each HTML file to see what elements/ids you can use to apply these styles.

Other than correcting any validation errors, you **MAY NOT** change any of the HTML.

In all cases, your layout should be flexible! Be sure to use the correct properties and values to achieve this. Pay attention to detail -- such as whitespace (you will need to adjust box model properties in a couple cases) and content constraint (you will need to center each `#wrapper` within body).

#### Two-Column Layout

1. Review `01-two-columns.png` in the `examples` directory. Your challenge is to replicate this following the steps below.

2. Create a two column grid with each column being of equal width.

3. Apply a 20px grid gap.

4. Keep the entire layout constrained within 960px.

5. Adjust whitespace for the remaining content using box model properties.


### Three-Column Layout

1. 1. Review `02-three-columns.png` in the `examples` directory. Your challenge is to replicate this following the steps below.

2. Apply a three-column grid with the middle column double the width of the two outer columns.

3. Apply a 15px grid gap.

4. Keep the entire layout constrained within 800px.

5. Adjust whitespace for the remaining content using box model properties.
