## Practice Set 3: Structural Markup

### Objectives

- Organize content using structural HTML tags

### Download this Repository

You can download this repository by clicking the green 'Code' button and selecting 'Open with GitHub Desktop'.

### Files

Once this repository has been cloned (downloaded) to your computer, you should have the following files within the `practice-set-03` directory on your computer:

- README.md (this file)
- retro-blog.html
- retro-computers.html
- style.css

Do not create or move any files outside of the `practice-set-03` directory for this exercise!

### Instructions

As you go through each step, I recommend checking the code in Firefox. If something is incorrect, you will find the mistake easier to catch if there is less code to review.


#### Part I: header, nav, main, address and footer

1. Review the content in `retro-computers.html`. You will see the content has been marked up using semantic HTML.

2. Identify what content would exist inside a `header`, `nav`, `main`, `address` and `footer`. Print out the page as it appears in a web browser, then draw boxes around the content which would appear in each of these structural tags. *All* content should fall into one of the structural tags.

3. Add the structural tags to `retro-computers.html` based on how you drew then up on the printed document. (Obviously you'll add the starting tag where the top of your box is, and the closing tag where it ends.)

4. [Validate your code](https://validator.w3.org). Make any necessary corrections so the validator returns no warnings or errors.

5. When your code is valid, add the following line of code below the `title` tag: `<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />`

6. Refresh your browser. If you did everything correctly, you'll see boxes around each structural tag you added as well as the corresponding label.


#### Part II: section, article, aside

1. Review the content in `retro-blog.html`. You will see the content has been marked up using semantic and some structural tags.

2. Within `main`, identify what content would exist inside a `section`, `article` and `aside`. Print out the page as it appears in a web browser, then draw boxes around the content which would appear in each of these structural tags.

3. Add the structural tags to `retro-blog.html` baed on how you drew them up on the printed document.

4. [Validate your code](https://validator.w3.org). Make any necessary corrections so the validator returns no warnings or errors.

5. When your code is valid, add the following line of code below the `title` tag: `<link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" />`

6. Refresh your browser. If you did everything correctly, you'll see boxes around each structural tag you added as well as a corresponding label.


#### Bonus

Consider revisiting `retro-computers.html` and marking up the content within `main` using `section` and `article` (nothing can be classified as an `aside` in this example). How might you accomplish this?


### Tips

- **Read the instructions** before beginning work. Understand what you are trying to accomplish before you write one piece of code.

- **Complete one task at a time.** Do not jump ahead. These steps are designed to help you develop a routine for creating a document structure.

- **Keep a checklist.** After you finish a task, check it off. If you need to set the practice aside, you'll know what step to come back to.

- **Track your questions.** If there's something you are unsure of, make a note to yourself in a notebook or using comments in your code. We can address these in class.

- **Be patient.** If you run into a difficult task, try working through the problem. It is okay to take your time. Refer to your notes or book. (Be careful about random sources on the Internet; they may give you bad information.)

If something does not work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did I forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in my tags, attributes or values?
- Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Is the file displayed in my browser the same one I am working on (check file names, directory paths)?
- What is the validator telling me?
- Am I writing the correct path?

### Solution

A solution (plus a copy of these files for future practice) for this exercise will be posted by Monday, Sept. 14.
