      <h2>Zoom Suffers Worldwide Outages</h2>

      <p><time datetime="2020-08-24">August 24, 2020</time></p>

      <p>Videoconferencing platform Zoom experienced worldwide outages Monday morning, coinciding with the first day of remote classes for many schools and universities.</p>

      <p>On its status page, Zoom reported partial outages for its website, meetings and webinars. By Monday afternoon, all systems were reported as operational.</p>

      <p>Downdetector recorded a spike in issue reports, mostly from North America and western Europe, which peaked at nearly 17,000 complaints at 9 a.m. EST.</p>

      <p>Lighter areas on Downdetector’s map Monday morning also showed complaints in China, India, Mexico and other countries, although most had faded by the afternoon.</p>

      <p>The company’s Twitter mentions were flooded with concerned and panicked users, including professors and students.</p>

      <p>“Please fix the system — we depend on your availability,” wrote Janine M. Ziermann, an assistant professor at Howard University’s College of Medicine in Washington.</p>

      <p>“Half of my student's [sic] don't get emails due to server failure ... Zoom seems down ... my lecture starts in 43 minutes,” she wrote, alongside an animated image from TV show The Big Bang Theory of a character hyperventilating into a paper bag.</p>

      <p>Zoom announced it was investigating the problems at 8:51 a.m. EST and said by 11:30 a.m. it had rolled out a fix for most users.</p>

      <p>“Everything should be working properly now!” the company tweeted, offering its “sincere apologies” to customers.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Everything should be working properly now! We are continuing to monitor the situation. Thank you all for your patience and our sincere apologies for disrupting your day.</p>

        <p>— Zoom (@zoom_us) August 24, 2020</p>
