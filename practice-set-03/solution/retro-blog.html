          <h2>Zoom Suffers Worldwide Outages</h2>

          <p><time datetime="2020-08-24">August 24, 2020</time></p>

          <p>Videoconferencing platform Zoom experienced worldwide outages Monday morning, coinciding with the first day of remote classes for many schools and universities.</p>

          <p>On its status page, Zoom reported partial outages for its website, meetings and webinars. By Monday afternoon, all systems were reported as operational.</p>

          <p>Downdetector recorded a spike in issue reports, mostly from North America and western Europe, which peaked at nearly 17,000 complaints at 9 a.m. EST.</p>

          <p>Lighter areas on Downdetector’s map Monday morning also showed complaints in China, India, Mexico and other countries, although most had faded by the afternoon.</p>

          <p>The company’s Twitter mentions were flooded with concerned and panicked users, including professors and students.</p>

          <p>Zoom announced it was investigating the problems at 8:51 a.m. EST and said by 11:30 a.m. it had rolled out a fix for most users.</p>

          <p>“Everything should be working properly now!” the company tweeted, offering its “sincere apologies” to customers.</p>

          <aside>
            <blockquote>
              <p>Everything should be working properly now! We are continuing to monitor the situation. Thank you all for your patience and our sincere apologies for disrupting your day.</p>
