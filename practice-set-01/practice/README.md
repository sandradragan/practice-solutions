## Practice Set 1: HTML Basics

### Objectives

- Get familiar with Atom
- Craft the necessary foundation for an HTML document
- Practice using tags for headings, paragraphs, lists and images


### Download this Repository

You can download this repository by clicking the green 'Code' button and selecting 'Open with GitHub Desktop'.


### Files

Once this repository has been cloned (downloaded) to your computer, you should have the following files within the `practice-set-01` directory on your computer:

- README.md (this file)
- apple.txt
- macintosh.jpg

Do not create or move any files outside of the `practice-set-01` directory for this exercise!


### Instructions

As you go through each step, I recommend checking the code in Firefox. If something is incorrect, you will find the mistake easier to catch if there is less code to review.

1. Review the content within `apple.txt`. Identify the information for what it is.

  - What bits of text are paragraphs lists?
  - What content will be heading(s) (and what 'level')?
  - What is the page title?

  Consider printing `apple.txt` and write down what tag you would use for each piece of content. Use this for reference as you code.

  *Note:* Text enclosed within [brackets] should not appear on the page; this is to identify the caption for the image provided.

2. Create a new file `index.html` in the `practice-set-01` directory.

3. Add a document structure to `index.html`. This should include the doctype, `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags. Make sure your tags are closed and properly nested.

4. Within the `<head>` tags, add your `<meta>` tag to include a character set.

5. Add a `<title>` inside `<head>`. Refer to your notes from the first step to determine what the page title should be.

6. Within the `<body>`, mark up your headings, paragraphs and lists.

  When writing code, you may copy and paste text into your html document; **do not** copy and paste code! (Actually *writing* the tags will help you learn them; copy/paste doesn't help you develop the same memory!)

7. Add the image. Place it anywhere below your `<h1>`. Make sure the image appears in your browser!

8. [Validate](https://validator.w3.org/) your code by uploading your `index.html` file to the W3C Validator. If the validator returns errors, go back and fix them.

If you have followed the steps above correctly, the Validator will still return a warning asking for `lang="en"` to be added to the `<html>` tag. `lang` is an attribute we will discuss at a later date. But in the meantime, try adding this attribute and value to the `<html>` tag.

When the page appears as it should (i.e. no broken images, code) and the validator says "No errors or warnings to show." on a green bar, you have completed this exercise!


### Tips

- **Read the instructions** before beginning work. Understand what you are trying to accomplish before you write one piece of code.

- **Complete one task at a time.** Do not jump ahead. These steps are designed to help you develop a routine for creating a document structure.

- **Keep a checklist.** After you finish a task, check it off. If you need to set the practice aside, you'll know what step to come back to.

- **Track your questions.** If there's something you are unsure of, make a note to yourself in a notebook or using comments in your code. We can address these in class.

- **Be patient.** If you run into a difficult task, try working through the problem. It is okay to take your time. Refer to your notes or book. (Be careful about random sources on the Internet; they may give you bad information.)

If something does not work as you expect, ask yourself:

- Did I forget to close a tag?
- Are there typos in my tags, attributes or values?
- Did I forget to include quotes around attributes?
- Is the file displayed in my browser the same one I am working on (check file names, directory paths)?
- What is the validator telling me?


### Solution

A solution (plus a copy of these files for future practice) for this exercise will be posted Monday, Aug. 31.
