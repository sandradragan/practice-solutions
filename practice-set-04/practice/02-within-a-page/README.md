## Linking Within a Page

### Instructions

As you go through each step, I recommend checking the code in Firefox. If something is incorrect, you will find the mistake easier to catch if there is less code to review.

1. Review content in `constitution.html`, a marked up version of the U.S. Constitution. This is not the complete document, but as you can see it is quite long. We're going to add a few links in the navigation to specific points in the document.

2. Apply an `id` to the section tags which contain the **Preamble**, **Articles** and **Amendments**.

3. Using the `id`s you just created, link the content of the list items in the navigation at the top of the page.

4. Check your links. Make sure clicking on any of the options in the navigation redirect you to the correct part of the page.

5. [Validate your code](https://validator.w3.org). Make any necessary corrections so the validator returns no warnings or errors.
