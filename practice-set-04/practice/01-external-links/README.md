## Linking to Other Web Sites

### Instructions

As you go through each step, I recommend checking the code in Firefox. If something is incorrect, you will find the mistake easier to catch if there is less code to review.

1. Review content in `links.html`. We're going to mark up Sebastian (the Ibis') favorite web sites.

2. Link the text "Sebastian the Ibis" in the first paragraph to https://miamihurricanes.com/sebastian-the-ibis/

3. Link the text "University of Miami" and "Miami Hurricanes" to their respective websites as provided below:

  - University of Miami: https://miami.edu
  - Miami Hurricanes: https://miamihurricanes.com/


3. Select another web site of your choice and link to it in the third list item.

4. Check your links. Make sure clicking link leads you to the web site you expect to visit!

5. [Validate your code](https://validator.w3.org). Make any necessary corrections so the validator returns no warnings or errors.
