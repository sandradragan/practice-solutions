## Web Photos (jpg)

### Instructions

*Note:* There are not necessarily right or wrong answers for this exercise. It is more about working through the process of editing images, making sure they are exported to a proper format and developing a personal sense of what "looks good" versus the file size of an image.

An HTML document has been provided for you which includes paths to images which have not yet been created. Your task is to export the image into different file formats.


1. Open `coral-reef-original.jpg` in Photoshop.

2. Crop the photo so the image focuses more on the fish to the right. (You'll probably cut out the orange fish on the left and bottom.) Try to put the Blue Tang ("Dory" fish) in the bottom right crosshairs establishing a focal point using the "Rule of Thirds."

3. In the "Image Size" menu, change the resolution to 72 pixels per inch. Change the width to 600 pixels. The height should automatically adjust.

4. Using the "Save for Web (Legacy)" panel, you will export this image five times, once for each of the pre-set quality options. Export the images in the following order -- Maximum, Very High, High and Low. Do not change the "Quality" setting.

  Before exporting these files, note the size of the file in the bottom, left corner of the panel. Include the quality setting and file size in the paragraph below each image in `index.html`. Name each exported file according to the filenames specified in `index.html`. (Be sure to save these in the `02-photos` folder.)

5. Return to the "Save for Web (Legacy)" panel and export an image with the Medium setting. This time, however, use the "Quality" setting just to the right to adjust this value. Try to get it as low as possible until you feel the quality is starting to degrade more than you prefer. Consider working in increments of 5.

  As with the previous images, note the file size in the bottom left corner. Add the quality and file size information below each image in `index.html`. Name the exported file according to the filename specified in `index.html`.

6. When finished, view the completed `index.html` file in your web  browser. Inspect the differences in file size and whether there are any discernible quality defects.

### Takeaway

If you have done this exercise properly, you should note that images saved with lower quality are not as bad as you think they are.

Compare the Maximum and Very High images. It's likely you'll have a difficult time spotting distinct flaws in the Very High image which make it look worse than the Maximum image. By dropping only 20% in quality, you will probably see a drop in file size of more than half!

For the most part, images you export will be of High or Medium quality. Which you choose will depend heavily on the detail of the image and the file size. If your combined page weight isn't pushing the limit of ~1-2MB, you may be able to afford better quality images. But if you don't have the bits to spare, you may have to resort to images of slightly lower quality.

It's a balancing act. :)
