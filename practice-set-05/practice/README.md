### Instructions

Instructions for each exercise are included in their respective folder.


### Tips

- **Read the instructions** before beginning work. Understand what you are trying to accomplish before you write one piece of code.

- **Complete one task at a time.** Do not jump ahead. These steps are designed to help you develop a routine for creating a document structure.

- **Keep a checklist.** After you finish a task, check it off. If you need to set the practice aside, you'll know what step to come back to.

- **Track your questions.** If there's something you are unsure of, make a note to yourself in a notebook or using comments in your code. We can address these in class.

- **Be patient.** If you run into a difficult task, try working through the problem. It is okay to take your time. Refer to your notes or book. (Be careful about random sources on the Internet; they may give you bad information.)


### Solution

As this exercise is more about giving you the experience of editing and exporting graphics for the web, there aren't necessarily right/wrong answers -- it is the process that matters. Feel free to compare your work against the solution, which has already been posted.
